# Trainsquare
Trainsquare is an educational and skills platform which allows its users to host their own in-person and online workshops as well as book courses, lessons and activities. Trainsquare is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.

My role as a software engineer was to implement the functionality of the administrator dashbaord. I was required to handle all the coding from the backend to the frontend. Below is a list of the actions I took to accomplish my responsibilities.

● Developed and structured the administrator dashboard functionality from front-end to back-end.

● Created the necessary procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination.

● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.

● Designed components in React to maximize aesthetics and functionality.

● Utilized styling with CSS and Bootstrap.

● Focused on best practices using proper naming convention and casing to avoid compiler issues with team member’s code.

● Maintained workflow using GitBash and GitHub for repo management.

● Created new branches to maintain organization throughout the project.
